With the use of appropriate object oriented programming features create class Shape and subclasses Triangle, Circle, Rectangle, Sphere, Cube and method calculate area for all the shapes and the method calculate volume for the three dimensional shapes.

Your program should ask the user to select a shape and enter the properties of the shape such as length, height, breadth or radius. Then return the Area and volume (if it is a 3D shape) of the selected shape to the user.
